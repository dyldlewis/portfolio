        <p>Hello, my name is Dylan Dero Lewis. I am currently 20 years old and was born and raised in Vancouver, Washington. I have a passion for computers and have been using technology from a very young age. I was first introduced to code in 2007 while tampering with a Java based online game called Runescape. Since then I have been fascinated with the architecture of webpages and software.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Although I am not super experience with code, I am familiar wtih some web design concepts and have created several websites using the content management system called Wordpress. These include <a href="http://sundinrealty.org">Sundin Realty</a>, <a href="http://www.denimandfrills.com">Denim and Frills</a>, and <a href="http://derodigitalmarketing.com"> Dero Digital Marketing.</a></p>

              <p>Although coding is my favorite hobby, I enjoy many other things. I really value spending time with friends and family, and I also enjoy both listening to and creating music. When I'm not hanging out with friends or jamming out, I'm probably playing video games.</p>
