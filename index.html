        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Dylan Dero Lewis. I am currently 20 years old and was born and raised in Vancouver, Washington. I have a passion for computers and have been using technology from a very young age. I was first introduced to code in 2007 while tampering with a Java based online game called Runescape. Since then I have been fascinated with the architecture of webpages and software.</p>
